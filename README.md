# roads
This code generates a hex map, which you can use to create the shortest routes between coordinates. You can choose the direct route or circle route. I used Breadth-first search, Dijkstras algorithm and "Travelling salesman problem" for solving this task. To test this code you need to use a file (for example: hex_route_test.txt). You need to put the number of points (coordinates) into the first line y for the route, the radius of the hex map into the second line, and then you can list the coordinates.
