# roads
This code generate the hex map, with which you can to create the shortest routes between coordinates.
You can make usual route and circle route. I have used Breadth-first search, Dijkstras algorithmus and "Travelling salesman problem".
For code testing you need to use file to be read (hex_route_test.txt). In first line you can set the number of 
points (coordinates) for the route, in second line the radius of hex map, and then list the coordinates.
